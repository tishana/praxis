    <h2>About Praxis...</h2>

    <h5>Praxis, your personal habit tracker</h5>
    <h5>Set goals, track habits, and win at life!</h5>

    <p>Praxis is a project I created while in the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly.</p>

    <p>I am a firm believer in goal setting as a way to be able to get the most out of life. I set goals, break
        those
        goals into smaller pieces, or habits. I then tick each habit off as they are completed.</p>

    <p>Now, you can do the same with Praxis. You can set new goals, and for each goal set a goal date, and create
        smaller habits for each goal. When you are done with the goal, you can delete it.</p>
